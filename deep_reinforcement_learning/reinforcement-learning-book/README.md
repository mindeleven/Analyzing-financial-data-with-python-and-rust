# Studying and Coding Along with „Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python“

This repository has the sole purpose of theoretical concepts about deep and reinforcement while coding along with the printed book „Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python“ by  Nimish Sanghi. It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

## RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback) for Chatbots and Large Language Models

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from „Deep Reinforcement Learning with Python“ by Nimish Sanghi.
