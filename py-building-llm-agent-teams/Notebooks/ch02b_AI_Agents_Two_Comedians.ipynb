    "__State altering agents - stand up comedy:__ In this example, we are going to create two agents. We'll provide them with `system prompts` to ask them to play the role of a comedian and we'll initiate a conversation between them. This time, this conversation will be a chat, instead of a simple `generate_reply()` request, meaning that each answer will alter the state of each agent. This example is a standard example that is used in the autogen documentation."

      "And why do they always want you to visualize a safe space? My safe space is right next to my fridge!

      "And let’s not forget the classic homework they give you! “I want you to find three things that make you happy.” Oh great, now I’m just on a scavenger hunt for a reason not to cry! I’m out here Googling memes and hunting down pictures of baby animals like I’m on a reality show.\n",
      "\n",

      "And you know, for the ‘Cry It Out’ contest, we could have a crying judge who ranks tears on a scale of 1 to 10. “Oh, that was a solid 8! But if you want to hit that coveted 10, maybe think of all the times you’ve burnt toast!” \n",
