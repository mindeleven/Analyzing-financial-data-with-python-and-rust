    "__State altering agents: stand up comedy:__ In this example, we are going to create two agents. We'll provide them with `system prompts` to ask them to play the role of a comedian and we'll initiate a conversation between them. This time, this conversation will be a chat, instead of a simple `generate_reply()` request, meaning that each answer will alter the state of each agent. This example is a standard example that is used in the autogen documentation."
