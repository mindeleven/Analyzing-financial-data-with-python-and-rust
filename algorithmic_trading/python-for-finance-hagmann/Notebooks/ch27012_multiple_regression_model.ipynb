    "- A multiple linear regression model captures correlations between independent variables: typically the independent variables are not completely uncorrelated. There might be a positive or negative correlation between some independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we add an additional independent variable to our model,\n",
    "  - the usually the slope coefficients of other independent variables of our model change (they don't have to!)\n",
    "  - the p-values of other independent variables (can) change\n",
    "  - the significance of other independent variables (can) change\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take our example of a simple linear regression model with the dependent variable revenue and the independent variable budget. In this example budget is significant. If we add now an additional independent variable, for instance the average rating, this could lead to an increase of the p-value for the budget and therefore we could conclude that when adding an additional independent variable the budget is no longer significant and should be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Omitting important independent variable(s) can distort the model which means that we need to identify and select the right set of independent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- The downside of this is, if we had too many independent variables that are highly correlated, this can lead to ***multicollinearity*** and requires a model re-specification."
