    "\n",
    "A sample space, typically denoted as S or Ω (omega), is the set of all possible outcomes that can occur in a given random experiment or random process. It represents every possible result that could happen when you conduct the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples to illustrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flipping a coin once:\n",
    "   - S = {Heads, Tails}\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Rolling a six-sided die:\n",
    "   - S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drawing a card from a standard deck:\n",
    "   - S = {all 52 cards in the deck}\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Measuring the lifetime of a light bulb:\n",
    "   - S = {x | x ≥ 0}, representing all possible non-negative real numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample spaces can be:\n",
    "- Finite: Contains a countable number of outcomes (like coin flips)\n",
    "- Infinite but countable: Like the set of all possible natural numbers\n",
    "- Infinite and uncountable: Like all possible real numbers in an interval\n",
    "\n",
    "***The sample space forms the foundation for probability theory, as all events are subsets of the sample space.*** Any probability calculation must consider the context of its sample space, as this defines what outcomes are actually possible in the experiment."

    "> 1. First, let's identify the possible outcomes for each component:\n",
    ">    * 4-sided die: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    ">    * Coin: {H, T} (Heads, Tails)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 2. Since we're rolling the die 3 times and tossing the coin once, each outcome in our sample space will be a 4-tuple (D1, D2, D3, C) where:\n",

    ">    * D3 = third die roll result\n",

    ">    * Each die roll has 4 possibilities\n",
    ">    * The coin toss has 2 possibilities\n",
    ">    * Using the multiplication principle: 4 × 4 × 4 × 2 = 128 total outcomes\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 4. The sample space S can be written as:\n",
    ">    S = {(d1, d2, d3, c) | d1, d2, d3 ∈ {1,2,3,4}, c ∈ {H,T}}\n",

    "> \n",
    "> Let me explain this with a concrete example:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Consider rolling a six-sided die once:\n",
    "> - Sample Space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "> \n",

    "> 3. Event C = \"rolling a prime number\" = {2, 3, 5}\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Important properties of events:\n",
    "> - The empty set ∅ is an event (impossible event)\n",
    "> - The entire sample space S is an event (certain event)\n",
    "> - If A is an event, its complement A' is also an event\n",
    "> - Union, intersection, and difference of events are also events\n",
