# Python Project: A deep understanding of deep learning


This is a code along with the Udemy Couse `A deep understanding of deep learning` to get a better understanding of how to use LLMs in general and expecially for trading stock and crypto assets.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey of deep learning and how to implement it in Python.

## Master deep learning in PyTorch using an experimental scientific approach, with lots of examples and practice problems
