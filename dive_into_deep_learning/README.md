# Studying and Coding Along with „Dive into Deep Learning“

This repository has the sole purpose of theoretical concepts about deep and reinforcement while coding along with the printed book „Dive into Deep Learning“ by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li & Alexander J. Smola. It is a personal documentation of moving forward in my learning journey.

> Deep learning has revolutionized pattern recognition, introducing tools that power a wide range of technologies in such diverse fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition. Applying deep learning requires you to simultaneously understand how to cast a problem, the basic mathematics of modeling, the algorithms for fitting your models to data, and the engineering techniques to implement it all. This book is a comprehensive resource that makes deep learning approachable, while still providing sufficient technical depth to enable engineers, scientists, and students to use deep learning in their own work. No previous background in machine learning or deep learning is required-every concept is explained from scratch and the appendix provides a refresher on the mathematics needed. Runnable code is featured throughout, allowing you to develop your own intuition by putting key ideas into practice.

Code examples and most of the explanations I've added as comments are borrowed from the „Dive into Deep Learning“ book and the accompanying website [d2l.ai](https://d2l.ai/).
