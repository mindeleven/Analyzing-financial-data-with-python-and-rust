    "__The Modern Concept of Reinforcement Learning is a combination of two different threads:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Concept of Optimal Control:__ \"Optimal control refers to solving problems where decisions are made continuously over time, considering changing information, by using the concept of 'cost-to-go' to minimize integrated costs from a current state to a target state.\" ([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/optimal-control)) <br/>One approach to the problem of optimal control was Richard Bellman's discipline of *dynamic programming*, formalized in 1950. Bellman's dynamic programming is all about planning through the space of various options, using *Bellman recursive equations*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Concept of Trial and Error:__ In 1910 Edward Thorndike formalised this theory into a *law* of psychology - *the law of effect*. In full it reads: \"Of several responses made to the same situation those which are accompanied or closely followed by satisfaction to the animal will, other things being equal, be more firmly connected with the situation, so that, when it recurs, they will be more likely to recur; those which are accompanied or closely followed by discomfort to the animal will, other things being equal, have their connections to the situation weakened, so that, when it recurs, they will be less likely to occur. The greater the satisfaction or discomfort, the greater the strengthening or weakening of the bond.\" ([faculty.sfcc.spokane.edu](https://faculty.sfcc.spokane.edu/InetShare/AutoWebs/KarlA/SPRING%202004/Ps101_Chap5_Article1.htm))\n",

    "In short, these concepts are about __increasing the occurence of good outcomes__ and __decreasing the occurence of bad outcomes__."
