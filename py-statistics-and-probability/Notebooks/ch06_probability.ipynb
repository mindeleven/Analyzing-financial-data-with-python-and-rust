    "A variable is called a random variable if we cannot predict the next realization of this variable. We need to define the domain (sample space) of this random variable, eg. {1, 2, 3}, which means the domain is the set containing 1, 2 and 3. If we know the domain we need to apply a probability for each event. The sum of the probability of each event must be equal to one.\n",

    "- A random variable quantifies our uncertainty about the quantity it represents, not the value that it happens to finally take once the outcome is revealed. You should never think of a random variable as having a fixed numerical value. If the outcome is known, then that determines a realization of the random variable (https://theoryandpractice.org/stats-ds-book/random_variables.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A random variable is defined as a function that associates outcomes of an experiment with real numbers. It can be discrete or continuous, depending on whether the outcomes are finite or infinite, forming the basis for probability distributions and density functions (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/random-variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A random variable (also called random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable) is a mathematical formalization of a quantity or object which depends on random events. The term 'random variable' in its mathematical definition refers to neither randomness nor variability (Wikipedia)."
