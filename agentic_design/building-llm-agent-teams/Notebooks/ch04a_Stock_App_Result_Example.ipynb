    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Price Performance**\n",
    "    - Over the past six months, AMD has seen a decline of 25.40%, while NVIDIA has appreciated by 65.07%.\n",
    "    - The sharp contrast in performance hints at varying market sentiments and expectations for each company.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Valuation Metrics**\n",
    "    - **P/E Ratios**: AMD's high P/E ratio of 157.48 suggests that it may be overvalued compared to NVIDIA's 61.71. However, AMD's forward P/E of 24.41 indicates better future earnings expectations.\n",
    "    - **Price to Book**: At 52.82, NVIDIA's price-to-book ratio is significantly higher than AMD's 3.79, indicating investors' optimism about NVIDIA's growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Debt and Returns**\n",
    "    - **Debt to Equity**: NVIDIA's debt/equity ratio of 22.87 is considerably higher than AMD's 3.97, raising concerns about its leverage.\n",
    "    - **Return on Equity (ROE)**: NVIDIA's robust ROE of 1.1566 dwarfs AMD's 0.0242, highlighting NVIDIA�s effective utilization of shareholders' equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient between AMD and NVIDIA stands at -0.24, suggesting a weak and inverse relationship. This anti-correlation implies that the stocks do not move in tandem, hence providing potential hedging opportunities for diversified portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental Metric Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P/E Ratio**: Indicates how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. AMD�s high P/E suggests high future earnings expectations, while NVIDIA�s lower P/E indicates relatively more reasonable current valuations.\n",
    "- **Forward P/E**: Similar to the P/E ratio but based on future earnings estimates. This metric provides a forward-looking perspective on valuation.\n",
    "- **Price to Book**: Compares a company's market value to its book value, providing insight into market perceptions of the company�s growth potential.\n",
    "- **Debt to Equity (D/E)**: Measures a company's financial leverage. A high D/E ratio indicates significant debt, which can be risky if not managed well.\n",
    "- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Indicates how well a company utilizes its equity to generate profits. A higher ROE is generally favorable.\n",
