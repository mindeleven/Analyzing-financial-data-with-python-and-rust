# Python Project: AI Agents: Building Teams of LLM Agents that Work For You


This is a code along with the Udemy Couse `AI Agents: Building Teams of LLM Agents that Work For You` to get a better understanding of how to use Autogen in general and expecially for trading stock and crypto assets.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey of the Python and Rust programming languages.

## AutoGen, ChatGPT API, Streamlit, Google Cloud, everything to build and deploy AI Agents based apps (locally or at scale)
