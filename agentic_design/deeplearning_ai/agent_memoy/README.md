# Agentic Design: LLMs as Operating Systems - Agent Memory


This is a code along with the online course `LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory` to get a better understanding of how to use agentic design in a way that makes sense for developing and implementing coding projects.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey of Python and LLMs.

Coding along with the deeplearning.ai course [LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory ](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/llms-as-operating-systems-agent-memory/lesson/1/introduction)  created with [Letta AI](https://www.letta.com/) and taught by its founders [Charles Packer](https://x.com/charlespacker) and [Sarah Wooders](https://x.com/sarahwooders).
