# Python Project: AutoGen AI Travel Agent

This is a code along with the video tutorial `AutoGen AI Travel Agent` to get a better understanding of the advantages that agentic design might have for building complex applications like a trading system.

The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey of the practical use of agentic design.

This advanced tutorial will explore the Autogen framework for managing multi-agent workflows. We will delve into how Autogen facilitates searching for flights by establishing a connection with the Amadeus API, writing data to a serverless SQL database, and executing queries on this data.
