Your feedback will help us resolve the issue more efficiently.\n",
      "Here are some common solutions for internet connectivity issues that you can consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Check Physical Connections**: Ensure that all cables (Ethernet, coaxial, power) are securely connected to your modem, router, and computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Restart Your Devices**: Power cycle your modem and router by unplugging them for about 30 seconds and then plugging them back in. This can often resolve connectivity issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Check for Service Outages**: Visit your internet service provider's website or contact their customer service to see if there are any outages in your area.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Run Network Troubleshooter**: If you are using a Windows device, you can run the built-in network troubleshooter by going to Settings > Network & Internet > Status > Network troubleshooter.\n",

      "5. **Forget and Reconnect to Wi-Fi**: If you are using Wi-Fi, try forgetting the network on your device and then reconnecting by entering the password again.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Update Network Drivers**: Ensure that your network drivers are up to date. You can check for updates through the Device Manager on Windows or System Preferences on macOS.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Check Firewall and Antivirus Settings**: Sometimes, firewall or antivirus software can block internet access. Temporarily disable them to see if it resolves the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Reset Network Settings**: As a last resort, you can reset your network settings. On Windows, go to Settings > Network & Internet > Status > Network reset. On mobile devices, this option is usually found in the settings under 'Reset' or 'Backup & Reset'.\n",
